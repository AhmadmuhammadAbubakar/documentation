Drupal 9 sites on Pantheon use the [drupal-project](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drupal-project) upstream. 

Unlike earlier Pantheon upstreams, the main branch of the `drupal-project` repository does not contain files that you are unlikely to adjust while building sites (including Drupal Core). Instead, these are managed by Composer as dependencies.
