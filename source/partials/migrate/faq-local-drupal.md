Drupal users with access to Drush 8 or earlier can run the provided Drush command to generate an archive then upload it to a third party service (like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)) to continue the standard migration procedure. If Drush 8 is not available, or the archive file size exceeds 500MB you must [manually migrate](/migrate-manual).
