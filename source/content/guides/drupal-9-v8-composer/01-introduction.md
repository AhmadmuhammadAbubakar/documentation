This guide will show you how to migrate a site that meets the following criteria to Drupal 9:

## Requirements

You must be on Drupal 8 and using Integrated Composer to use this guide. You can confirm that Integrated Composer is set up by checking that your site has the [Pantheon drupal-recommended repo](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-recommended) in its upstream.
