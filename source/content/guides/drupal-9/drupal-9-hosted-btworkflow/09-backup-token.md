1. Connect to your site using SFTP command or credentials from your dashboard and get a backup of the following file:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  files/private/.build-secrets/tokens.json
  ```

1. Use the SFTP `get` command to download the file to your local directory (this is only for SFTP command line use):

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  echo "get files/private/.build-secrets/tokens.json" | $(terminus connection:info $DESTINATION_SITE_NAME.dev --format=string --field=sftp_command)
  ```
