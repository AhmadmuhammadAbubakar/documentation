The **Database** import requires a single `.sql` dump that contains the site's content and configurations.

1. Navigate to your existing site's Dashboard.

1. In the Live environment, select **<span class="fa fa-server"></span> Database / Files**.

1. Click **Export Database**.

1. Download the resulting file, or copy the URL for archives over 500 MB.

Import the archive:
