<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

Follow the steps in the [Composer Conversion Guide](/guides/composer-convert) to ensure that your site is ready for upgrade to Drupal 9.

</Alert>

## Verify the Repository

1. Check that your site has the [Pantheon drupal-composer-managed repo](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed) in its upstream.

1. Use Terminus to confirm the `drupal-composer-managed` upstream:

  ```bash
  terminus site:info $SITE 
  ```

  The following values indicate that a site is using the `drupal-composer-managed` upstream:

   - The `Framework` is `drupal8`
   - The `Upstream` includes `https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed`

   The following is an abridged example of the output for the `terminus site:info $SITE` command, if the site upstream is set to `drupal-composer-managed`:

   ```bash{outputLines:2-13}
   terminus site:info $SITE
