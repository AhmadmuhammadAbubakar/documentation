## Prepare the Local Environment

1. Get a local copy of both your new site (from the external repository) and your existing site codebase.

1. In the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench"></span> Dev** tab of the site's Dashboard, set the **Development Mode** to **Git**, and [clone the site locally](/local-development#get-the-code).

1. Change into the `$SITE` directory, then create a new branch based on the default:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   cd $SITE
   git checkout -b d9-upg-21
   ```

1. Use Terminus and Drush to export the latest version of the config files from the production environment to `sites/default/files/config`:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   terminus drush $SITE.live -- config:export --destination sites/default/files/config
   ```

1. For rsync, copy the SFTP host information.

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   RSYNC_HOST=$(terminus connection:info $SITE.live --field=sftp_host)
   ```

1. Use that host name to rsync from `config:export`:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   rsync -rvlz --copy-unsafe-links --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' "${RSYNC_HOST}:files/config" .
   ```

1. If you run `git status` it should display changed files in the `config` directory if there are any changed configurations in production.

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   git status
   ```
