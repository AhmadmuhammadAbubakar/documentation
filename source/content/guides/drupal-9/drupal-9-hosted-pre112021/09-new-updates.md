After you complete the upstream change, you need to apply the available upstream updates. Use the Pantheon Dashboard in the Dev environment to apply updates. If this is not successful, continue to the next section for help resolving with merge conflicts.

### Solving Merge Conflicts When Applying Upstream Updates

Conflicts can occur when a modified file in your site's codebase does not align with changes made to the same file in the site's upstream.

> When a merge isnâ€™t resolved automatically, Git leaves the index and the working tree in a state that provides the information you need to resolve the merge.
>
> \- [Git Manual](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/)

If you receive an error that you have conflicts while updating, resolve using the `-Xtheirs` flag. This will automatically resolve the conflict with a preference for upstream changes.

This is safe to run if you don't have your own changes in any of the conflicting files, such as problems with `.gitignore`.

```bash{promptUser: user}
git pull -Xtheirs https://github.compantheon-upstreams/drupal-recommended.git master
# resolve conflicts
git push origin master
```
Check that the files are correct before going forward to ensure no bugs are introduced.

If you modified upstream files, the `-Xtheirs` flag will drop your changes. You can [manually resolve conflicts](/git-resolve-merge-conflicts#manually-resolve-conflicts) to fix this issue.

You will be in the Drupal with Composer upstream after you apply the upstream updates.
