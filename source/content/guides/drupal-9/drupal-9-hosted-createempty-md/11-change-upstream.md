Your Pantheon site is now set up to use the Drupal 9 Integrated Composer upstream. To continue tracking additional changes to the Pantheon upstream, change the upstream your site is tracking with Composer:

```bash{promptUser:user}
terminus site:upstream:set $SITE drupal-composer-managed
```

Following the `drupal-composer-managed` upstream will help keep your site up to date with any general configuration changes recommended by Pantheon. The dependency you added above on `drupal/core-recommended` will keep you on Drupal 8 until you are ready to upgrade to Drupal 9.
