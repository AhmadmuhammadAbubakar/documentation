## Requirements

You must confirm that you meet the following requirements before continuing:

- Your site is based on the [drupal/legacy-project](https://github.com/drupal/legacy-project/blob/9.1.x/composer.json) template or a similar non-composer managed structure.

- You are able to run `drush` commands in the existing site.

- You are able to check out your existing site codebase in your local machine.

- The site does not use another package and library manager, like [Ludwig](https://www.drupal.org/project/ludwig).

- You have a brand new Drupal Pantheon site to host your project.
