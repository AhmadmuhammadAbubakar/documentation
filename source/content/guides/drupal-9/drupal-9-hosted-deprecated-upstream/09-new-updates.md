Check for updates at this stage in migrating your Drupal site to [Drupal with Composer Upstream](/guides/integrated-composer#get-started-with-integrated-composer).

Follow the steps below after you have completed switching your upstream.

1. Navigate to your Pantheon Dashboard.

1. Click **Dev environment** > **Update** to apply available upstream updates.

If the updates are not successful, refer to the [Troubleshooting](/guides/drupal-9-hosted-deprecated-upstream/troubleshooting) doc.
