[New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring](https://newrelic.com/) offers a wide array of metrics that provide a nearly real-time look into the performance of a web application. New Relic makes it easy for you to monitor your performance and speed up the support process by helping our support team visualize corresponding performance and symptoms.

## Supported Site Plans

All plans except for a Basic plan can use New Relic. New Relic is available to Sandbox site plans for developmental purposes, but will not be available when your Basic plan goes live.
