This guide provides steps to upgrade or migrate a Drupal 8 or 9 site to Drupal 9 on the Pantheon Platform.

There are a number of ways to upgrade to Drupal 9 on Pantheon, depending on the site's start state and target site workflow. This guide will help you through your adventure.

## Before You Begin

Pantheon recommends using Composer to manage Drupal 8 and 9 site dependencies. This guide assumes you are using [Composer](/composer) with your Drupal site. 

### Create a New Drupal 9 Site

To get started with a new site, see our [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) and [Integrated Composer](/integrated-composer) doc.

### Convert Drupal 8 Site to Composer

If you are migrating or upgrading a Drupal 8 site without Composer, begin by [Converting a Standard Drupal 8 Site to a Composer Managed Site](/guides/composer-convert).
