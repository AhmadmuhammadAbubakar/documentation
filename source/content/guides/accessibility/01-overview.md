This guide provides an overview of how to optimize your website for accessibility. Using tools and techniques integrated with the Pantheon WebOps workflow, this guide will help you extend your site's impact, future-proof its content for uses we haven't though of yet, and build a sustainable accessibility practice across your WebOps teams. 

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are the internationally accepted guidelines for website accessibility. WCAG documents provide detailed explanations and examples on how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The current standard most used is [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/); [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/) is scheduled to be published in 2021. 

### Principles of accessibility and success criteria

The [WCAG principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#guidelines) that structure accessibility guidelines are for information and user interface components to be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). 

For each guideline, there are testable success criteria at three levels: [A, AA, and AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels). 


### WAI-ARIA for rich internet applications 

[WAI-ARIA 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) provides additional guidance for dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. It provides insights on ARIA roles, states, and properties to make custom widgets accessible, usable, and interoperable with assistive technologies and to those who rely on keyboard navigation.

### Semantic HTML

Using Semantic HTML regions and logical header order in page construction is a best practice that significantly improves the operability and navigation of a site or application. 


## How accessibility impacts SEO

Making a website fast is no longer enough to achieve the top spots on search results pages. User experience matters. Google's [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/) shift SEO to focus on multiple factors (including page speed) that contribute to great user experience. So removing barriers to use is key to SEO.



## Creating accessible websites and web applications

The start of a new site design is the easiest time to build a sustainably accessible site. 

## Planning and executing fixes to existing sites

To optimize an existing site for accessibility, 

1. begin with an assessment of the assets and pages on the site, 

1. identify the WCAG conformance target, 

1. determine how you will test changes, and 

1. create a plan to prioritize the changes you will make to maximize impact.

### Inventory and assess site pages

There are a number of tools available to help create an inventory and assessment of the conformance of your existing site pages to WCAG guidelines.

### WCAG conformance targets

Identify your target level of conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
