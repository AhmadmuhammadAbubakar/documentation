At Pantheon, we appreciate open source contributions. In an effort to effectively maintain our various public repositories in [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/pantheon-systems/repositories), we tag Pantheon repositories with support level badges. The badge is typically displayed in the repository's `README.md`. 

This page describes each support level and the support expectations for our public repositories.

## Actively Maintained Support

A project with actively maintained support has been publicly launched and [support]() is available. Pantheon has dedicated resources to ensuring the source code is current and reliable. Additionally, you can create issues and pull requests in the repository as needed and the project maintainer will respond in a timely manner.


## Limited Availability

A project in Limited Availabililty includes a features that are complete and can be used in all environments including production. Clients can use the new functionality without requiring an invite but it is an opt-in process. You are highly encouraged to report any bug you may find so that we can make a better product for everyone. Support in this stage is available through regular Pantheon channels.

## Early Access

An projec in Early access denotes a new product or feature set that is in deve. The code is publicly available, but if there are any accompaning platform components you will need an invitation through the project pilot program. Even though we make our best effort, there may be bugs and we need your help to identify them so that we can fix them. The product or feature set may not be feature complete and development is still going on. Support in this stage is provided by the Engineering team, and is only available to members of the program.

## Minimal Support

A project with minimal support receives only important bug or security updates. The repository is supported with major fixes. If there is an issue with the source code, we will make an effort to address it in a timely manner.

## Unofficial Support

A project that has unofficial support is often a Pantheon employee initiative. It typically does not have resources allocated for maintenance. Support is not guaranteed for the project because it depends on the availability of the project maintainer.

## Unsupported 

An unsupported repository is typically a project created only for internal use at Pantheon. Although the source code is accessible, support is not available and there are risks associated with using the repository's code.

## Deprecated 

A deprecated repository is a project that has been retired or replaced, and is no longer supported by Pantheon. Details about the repository can be found in the `README.md`. Additional information, such as suitable alternative projects or guidance on finding solutions, may be available in the [Community Slack](https://slackin.pantheon.io/). Using a project that has been deprecated is not encouraged.
