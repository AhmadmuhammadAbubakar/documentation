At Pantheon we love Open Source, we have created lots of public repositories in our [Github account](https://github.com/orgs/pantheon-systems/repositories) and we have started tagging them with support level badges. This page describes each of those levels and what should you expect when using those repositories.

## Pilot

A project in Pilot support level is a new product or feature set that we are working on. The code is publicly available but if there are any accompaning platform components you will need an invite through the project pilot program. Even though we make our best effort, there may be bugs and we need your help to identify them so that we can fix them. The product or feature set may not be feature complete and development is still going on. Support in this stage is provided by the Engineering team.

## Early Acess

A project in Early Access has the key use cases ready and we are ready to get some (more) customers in to continue the testing. In this stage, the code is publicly available but if there is any accompaning platform components you will need an invite through the project Early Access program. Even though we make our best effort, there may be bugs and we need your help to identify them so that we can fix them. The full product or feature set may not be feature complete. Support in this stage is provided by the Engineering team.

## Limited Availability

A project in this support level is a product or feature set that is complete and can be used in all environments including production. Clients can use the new functionality without requiring an invite but it is an opt-in process. You are highly encouraged to report any bug you may find so that we can make a better product for everyone. Support in this stage is provided by the Customer Success Engineering team.

## Actively Maintained

A project in this support level has been publicly launched and has several eyes over it ensuring that everything works as expected. Anyone could use this project and create issues and Pull Requests in the repository as needed and we will respond to them in a timely manner. Support in this stage is provided by the Customer Success Engineering team.

## Minimal Support

A project in this support level rarely receives updates but if there is an important bug or security update we will make our best effort to address it in a timely manner.

## Unsupported

A project in this support level rarely receives updates and people should not expect replies to issues or pull requests. You are encouraged to NOT use a project in this support level.

## Unofficial

A project in this support level is usually a Pantheon employee initiative. It probably does not have any resource allocated for maintenance and support is not guaranteed for this project because it depends on the project maintainer available time if they are still in the company.

## Deprecated

A project in this support level is no longer supported by Pantheon. This means it was either retired or replaced by another project. There may be details about this in the project README.md or you could try asking us in Slack if you are in a need for the replacement or guidance about where to go.
